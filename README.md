# Car Counter

![Car Counter Demo](assets/output_video.gif)

## Introduction

Car Counter is an intelligent system designed to automate the process of counting vehicles passing through a specified area in a video stream. It combines the power of computer vision techniques with state-of-the-art object detection and tracking algorithms to accurately count the number of cars in real-time.

## Motivation

In urban areas, traffic monitoring and management are crucial for ensuring safety, reducing congestion, and optimizing transportation systems. Manual vehicle counting methods are often time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to errors. Car Counter addresses these challenges by providing an automated solution that can efficiently monitor and analyze traffic flow.

## Key Features

- **Object Detection**: Car Counter utilizes the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection model to identify cars within video frames.
- **Tracking**: It employs the SORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking) algorithm to track the movement of detected cars across frames.
- **Real-Time Counting**: The system accurately counts the number of cars entering and exiting a defined region of interest (ROI) in the video stream.
- **Visualization**: Car Counter provides visual feedback by overlaying bounding boxes around detected cars and displaying real-time car counts.

## Use Cases

### Traffic Management

Car Counter can be deployed at intersections, toll booths, parking lots, or any location with heavy vehicular traffic. By continuously monitoring the flow of vehicles, it enables authorities to analyze traffic patterns, optimize signal timings, and implement congestion-reducing measures.

### Parking Management

In parking facilities, Car Counter can assist in monitoring occupancy levels and guiding drivers to available parking spaces. By accurately counting cars entering and exiting parking areas, it helps streamline operations and enhance the overall parking experience.

### Retail Analytics

Retailers can leverage Car Counter to measure foot traffic in their parking lots or driveways. By understanding the volume and flow of vehicles, they can make informed decisions regarding store operations, marketing strategies, and customer engagement initiatives.

## Installation

To set up Car Counter on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your computer.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Prepare a video file or connect a webcam for testing.
4. Run the main script using `python main.py`.

## Getting Started

Once Car Counter is up and running, follow these steps to start counting cars:

1. Adjust the region of interest (ROI) in the video to focus on the area of interest.
2. Observe the real-time display of detected cars and their movement.
3. Monitor the car counts as vehicles enter and exit the ROI.
4. Analyze the collected data to gain insights into traffic behavior and trends.

## Future Enhancements
- **Speed Estimation**: Integrate speed estimation algorithms to measure the velocity of moving vehicles and analyze traffic speed patterns.
- **Integration with GIS**: Integrate with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to visualize traffic data on maps and perform spatial analysis.
